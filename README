SPI Hack - Carl Worley <github+wirefree@kf5bau.net>

The GS1011 module only supports ASCII when used with the UART. If you want to
support binary data, you will have to wire the GS1011 SPI ports to the SPI
ports on the Platinum. Visit http://imgur.com/a/8pDxA to see a visual of how
the pins need to be wired.

GS1011          -  Platinum
SSPI_DIN  (30) <-- MOSI
SSPI_DOUT (27) --> MISO
SSPI_CLK  (28) <-- SCK
SSPI_CS   (29) <-- D3
GPIO28    (46) --> D2
GPIO26    (35) --- Pull-up to 3v3
